        <p>Daily UI offers a unique design prompt every day for 100 days and gives designers the opportunity to hone their skills and explore a wide variety of user experience problems.</p><br/>
        <p>It acted as a way for me to break outside my comfort zone—testing new interactions, learning new tools, and working with prompts I would not otherwise be able to design for. The following are a selection of projects from this challenge.</p><br/>

        <p><a href="#day1"><span class="underlinelinks">Day 001. Sign Up</span></a></p>
        <p><a href="#day6"><span class="underlinelinks">Day 006. User Profile</span></a></p>
        <p><a href="#day43"><span class="underlinelinks">Day 043. Food/Drink Menu</span></a></p>
        <p><a href="#day58"><span class="underlinelinks">Day 058. Shopping Cart</span></a></p>
        <p><a href="#day68"><span class="underlinelinks">Day 068. Flight Search</span></a></p>


    </div>

    <div class="pGroupLight" id="day1">

        <h2>Day 001. Sign Up</h2><br/>
        <h6>Tools: Sketch, Principle</h6><br/>
        <img src="images/day1.1.png" class="col-12"></img><br/>
        <p>For the first day, I wanted to create a simple but vibrant sign-in page for a mobile app. I noticed that links to sign up pages are often relegated to a small hyperlink near the bottom, which I find a little bothersome. So here, I was determined to give "Sign Up" its own button.</p><br/>
        <img src="images/day1.2.gif" class="col-12"></img><br/>
        <p>When animating the transition between the "Sign In" and "Sign Up" pages, I focused on the relationship between the two pages. I wanted to make sure they were distinct pages that each conveyed their different purposes, yet at the same time undeniably connected. </p><br/>

    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div class="pGroupLight" id="day6">

        <h2>Day 006. User Profile</h2><br/>
        <h6>Tools: Sketch</h6><br/>
        <img src="images/day6a.png" class="col-12"></img><br/>
        <p>For the prompt "User Profiles", I instantly thought of profiles on music-streaming sites. Spotify is an service I love and subscribe to but, I've never been a fan of the way their profiles for artists are laid out. This was not created as a solution to that or with Spotify solely in mind, but was my take on such a profile. </p><br/>

    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div class="pGroupLight" id="day43">

        <h2>Day 043. Food/Drink Menu</h2><br/>
        <h6>Tools: InVision Studio</h6><br/>
        <img src="images/day43a.gif" class="col-12"></img><br/>
        <p>I finished watching Chef's Table and also got (early) access to InVision Studio that same day, so naturally I decided to play around with it. Here's a design for the details of one of Chef Grant Achatz's dishes at Alinea.</p><br/>
        <p>This was my first time using InVision Studio and it was cool that I could easily prototype animations without having to switch back and forth between Sketch and Principle (especially if I want to revise something in the design). But as a creature of habit, I think I'll be sticking with Sketch for now.</p>

    <div class="pGroupLight" id="day58">

        <h2>Day 058. Shopping Cart</h2><br/>
        <h6>Tools: Sketch, Principle</h6><br/>
        <img src="images/day58a.png" class="col-12"></img><br/>
        <p>While in many previous designs, I have toyed with single-page interfaces or brief transitions between screens, I wanted to challenge myself to create something more complete and complex. So, instead of only designing the interface for the credit card information input itself, I decided to design the entire checkout experience—from reviewing the shopping cart to the actual payment. </p><br/>
        <img src="images/day58b.gif" class="col-12"></img><br/>
        <p class="caption">Transitions between the main checkout screen and those for entering information.</p><br/>
        <img src="images/day58c.gif" class="col-12"></img><br/>
        <p class="caption">The "Purchase" button appears once all fields have been filled out. </p><br/>
        <p>Animating the transitions and interactions for this interface was definitely among the most challenging things I've done so far. This entire project stretched and put to test my knowledge of Principle. Even as I write this now, I still see many flaws in the animation but it's about time I curbed my perfectionistic tendencies a little. </p>
